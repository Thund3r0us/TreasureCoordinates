# TreasureCoordinates w/ Backtracking

You have discovered a very old crumbly piece of parchment thatcontains a bunch of digits in between a pair of parentheses. 
You realize that these digits symbolize a precise location to a valuable piece of treasure. 
Luckily, you can put together the digits, however you are unsure if a decimal place exists from the wrinkles on the parchment. 
The best thing you can do is come up with all possibilities to at least get some idea of where the treasure is possibly located. 
In order to solve this problem, you will need to apply backtracking to generate all possible answers.
The coordinates are presented with a sequence of digits (0-9) all enclosed between a pair of parentheses. 
For example (123) is a sample input. 
This will result in the possible coordinates:
• (1, 2.3)
• (1, 23)
• (1.2, 3)
• (12, 3)
